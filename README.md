# VM Tips 2026 🏆

Live leaderboard app for the 2026 World Cup tips competition.

## Players
Jeppe, Christian Qvist, Paddy, Lukas, Chrilled, Chrisser, Magnor (Von Thistle)

## Features
- 🏅 Live leaderboard with group points + bonus points
- 🔴 **Automatic live results** — pulls real scores from ESPN's free public scoreboard API every 30 seconds, no API key needed
- **Live (+X pts) highlight** — while a match is in progress, anyone whose prediction matches the current score gets a flashing `(+X pts)` next to their name on the leaderboard, so you can watch points roll in live
- ⚽ All 72 group stage matches — see who predicted what
- 👤 Player detail view with per-match breakdown
- ⭐ Bonus rounds tracker (group finishes, R16, QF, SF, top scorer, winner)
- ✏️ Admin panel to manually correct results if needed (auto-sync is the default; manual entry overrides it)
- 🌑 Dark mode throughout

## How live results work

The app polls `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/fifa.world/scoreboard` — ESPN's free, public, no-key scoreboard endpoint — every 30 seconds while the app is open. It matches matches by team name to your prediction sheet automatically.

- **No setup required** — works the moment you deploy
- **No cost** — this is a free public endpoint
- **Manual override available** — if ESPN's data is ever wrong, missing, or delayed, use the ✏️ Resultater panel to correct it; manual entries always take priority over the live feed
- If the live fetch is ever blocked by a browser's CORS policy, the app automatically retries through a public CORS proxy. If both fail, a small warning banner appears and you can fall back to manual entry — nothing else breaks
- Since this is an unofficial/undocumented ESPN endpoint, it could theoretically change without notice; the manual entry panel is always there as a backup

## Setup

npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (fully automatic — no terminal needed)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes the app automatically every time you push, straight from GitHub Desktop. You only need to do this **once**:

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository (e.g. via GitHub Desktop → "Publish repository")
2. On GitHub.com, go to your repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Build and deployment" → **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo — you should see a workflow run start automatically (it runs on every push to `main`)
5. Wait about 1–2 minutes for it to finish (green checkmark ✅)
6. Your site is live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`

From now on, every time you commit and push changes (even from GitHub Desktop, no terminal needed), the site rebuilds and updates automatically within a minute or two.

**Note:** the `base` path in `vite.config.js` is auto-detected from your repo name during the GitHub Actions build, so you never need to edit it manually.

## How to use

- Open the app — everyone can see the live leaderboard and match predictions, updating automatically as real matches happen
- Watch the leaderboard during a live match — anyone whose prediction matches the current score shows a flashing `(+X pts)` next to their name
- Click **✏️ Resultater** only if you need to correct or manually add a result ESPN's feed missed
- Click **⭐ Bonus** to enter knockout round results as the tournament progresses (no free live source covers these long-term bonus bets, so they stay manual)
- Tap any player on the leaderboard to see their full prediction breakdown
- Tap any match in the Matches tab to see all 7 predictions side by side, with a 🔴 LIVE badge and match clock while it's in progress

## Data

All predictions are pre-loaded from the Excel sheet. Results are saved locally in the browser via `localStorage` — if you want the scores to sync between devices, host it somewhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify) and consider adding a simple backend or using a shared Google Sheet as a data source.
